## Installation
1. Clone the repo, e.g ```git clone https://github.com/juniorxsound/THREE-Multiplayer.git```
1. Run ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies

~~> Tested on macOS 10.13.3 using Node.js v8.9.3 and npm v5.6.0~~
Tested on Windows 10 using Node.js 16.17.0 and npm 8.15.0 

## Usage
Use ```npm run buildall``` to build the necessary bundler.js and copy socket.io.js in public folder
Use ```npm run start``` to start the server 

![NPM](https://github.com/juniorxsound/THREE-Multiplayer/blob/master/resources/run_start.gif)

The start script launches:
- ```nodemon``` Which restarts the server on every change (port: 1989)
- ```watchify``` Which bundles the client code from ```src/``` on every change to ```./public/js/bundle.js```

![Server Log](https://github.com/juniorxsound/THREE-Multiplayer/blob/master/resources/Logs.png)

On connection each client receives it's uniqe ID and on every movement broadcasts to all the other clients all the locations of everyone connected
```js
{
  'some-user-id': {
    position: [0.4, 1.4, -0.5],
    rotation: [0, 0, 0]
  }
}
```

You can also run ```npm run build``` to bundle and minify the client code to ```./public/js/bundle.min.js```

Browserify is setup to transform both ES6 Javascript and ```glslify``` for GLSL shader bundling ([example](https://github.com/juniorxsound/DepthKit.js) of a project that uses ```glslify```)
